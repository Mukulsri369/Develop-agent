BUILD A COMPLETE PRODUCTION-READY E-COMMERCE-STYLE AFFILIATE STORE FROM SCRATCH FOR “OUR VISIBLE UNIVERSE”

I want you to build a completely separate store website for my brand “Our Visible Universe”.

This is an astronomy/space-themed affiliate storefront.

IMPORTANT BUSINESS MODEL:
This is NOT a traditional e-commerce store.

I will NOT:

- Keep physical inventory
- Pack products
- Ship products
- Process customer payments
- Handle returns

Instead:

1. Products are displayed beautifully on my store website.
2. Each product has its own Amazon Associates affiliate URL.
3. Customer clicks “Buy on Amazon”.
4. Customer is redirected to the exact Amazon product page through my affiliate URL.
5. Amazon handles checkout, payment, shipping and fulfillment.
6. I earn applicable affiliate commission from qualifying purchases.

The website must be designed around this workflow.

==================================================

1. BRAND
   \==================================================

Brand name:

Our Visible Universe

The store should feel like a premium extension of an astronomy/universe exploration brand.

The design should communicate:

- Space
- Astronomy
- Exploration
- Curiosity
- Science
- Discovery
- Premium quality

Do NOT make it look like a generic Amazon clone.

Use a distinctive cosmic visual identity.

================================================== 2. WEBSITE URL / ARCHITECTURE
==================================================

This will be a completely separate website from the main Our Visible Universe application.

Suggested URL:

store.ourvisibleuniverse.com

The application must be independently deployable.

The main Our Visible Universe website will later have a simple “STORE” button that links to this store URL.

Do not depend on the main application for the store to function.

================================================== 3. TECHNOLOGY / ARCHITECTURE
==================================================

Build this as a real database-backed web application.

Do NOT hard-code products into frontend source code.

Use:

- Secure authentication
- Database
- Image/file storage
- Server-side protected operations
- Responsive frontend
- Proper routing
- SEO-friendly product URLs

The database must be the single source of truth for products.

The architecture must be scalable enough to eventually handle hundreds or thousands of products.

================================================== 4. PUBLIC WEBSITE PAGES
==================================================

Create these public pages:

/

Home

/shop

All Products

/category/:slug

Category page

/product/:slug

Product details

Create a completely protected admin area:

/admin/login

/admin/products

/admin/products/new

/admin/products/edit/:id

/admin/products/trash

/admin/categories

/admin/settings

Only authenticated administrators can access these pages.

================================================== 6. ADMIN ACCOUNT
==================================================

The initial administrator email must be:

mukul.srivastava.025@gmail.com

IMPORTANT:

Do NOT hard-code a password into the frontend.

Use secure authentication.

The administrator should create/set the password through the authentication system.

The email above should be configured as the initial authorized administrator.

Only this authorized admin should initially have administrative privileges.

Do NOT display the admin email publicly.

================================================== 7. ADMIN LOGIN
==================================================

Create a premium but simple admin login page.

URL:

/admin/login

Fields:

Email
Password

Buttons:

Sign In

Additional functionality:

- Show/hide password
- Loading state

- Secure logout
- Forgot/reset password if supported by the authentication provider

After successful authentication:

Redirect to:

/admin

If a non-authenticated user attempts to access an admin route:

Redirect to:

/admin/login

IMPORTANT:

Authentication and authorization must be enforced server-side/database-side, not only through frontend route protection.

The Amazon Affiliate URL must be stored individually for every product.

Do not redirect all products to Amazon's homepage.

Do NOT make the site excessively animated.

The products must remain the visual focus.

Prioritize:

over excessive visual effects.

================================================== 32. ADMIN DESIGN
==================================================

Admin dashboard should use the same brand identity but prioritize usability.

Use:

- Clean sidebar

- Forms
- Clear buttons

Do not use heavy animations in admin.

================================================== 33. DATABASE

Implement proper database access policies.

PUBLIC:

Can read:

- Active products
- Active categories

ADMIN:

Can:

- Create products
- Update products
- Delete products
- Manage images
- Manage categories
- Manage settings

Never allow public users to modify database records.

================================================== 35. ADMIN AUTHORIZATION
==================================================

The initial admin email:

mukul.srivastava.025@gmail.com

Must be recognized as an administrator.

Do not rely solely on the email being present in frontend code.

Store admin authorization securely.

Use proper backend/database authorization.

If using Supabase:

Use Supabase Auth.

Create an admin role/profile.

Use Row Level Security policies.

Do not expose service-role keys in the browser.

================================================== 36. SEO
==================================================

Every product should automatically generate:

- Canonical URL
- Open Graph title
- Open Graph description
- Open Graph image

Example:

SEO title:

Galaxy Projector | Our Visible Universe Store

Generate clean, human-readable URLs.

================================================== 37. AFFILIATE DISCLOSURE
==================================================

/affiliate-disclosure

page.

Include clear disclosure that the website participates in affiliate marketing and may earn commissions from qualifying purchases.

Also show an appropriate disclosure near affiliate purchase CTAs where required.

Do not misrepresent the relationship with Amazon.

================================================== 38. AMAZON COMPLIANCE
==================================================

IMPORTANT:

Do NOT scrape Amazon.

Do NOT build an unauthorized Amazon product scraper.

Do NOT automatically copy Amazon product information through unofficial methods.

Initially, product information will be entered manually by the admin.

Prepare the architecture for a future official Amazon-supported API integration.

If an official API is added later:

- Keep credentials server-side.
- Never expose credentials in frontend code.
- Follow applicable Amazon Associates policies.

================================================== 39. OUTBOUND CLICK TRACKING
==================================================

Optionally record:

- Product ID
- Timestamp
- Outbound click

This should measure clicks from our website to Amazon.

Do NOT claim that the system knows Amazon sales or commissions unless Amazon provides that data through an authorized integration.

Admin dashboard may show:

Total Amazon Clicks
Most-clicked Products

================================================== 40. PERFORMANCE
==================================================

Optimize the website for speed.

Use:

- Lazy-loaded images
- Responsive images
- Image compression
- Pagination
- Efficient database queries
- Caching where appropriate
- Code splitting

Do not use a heavy 3D universe background on every page.

The store should feel premium without becoming slow.

==================================================

Handle:

- Invalid product
- Missing image
- Missing Amazon URL
- Database errors
- Authentication errors
- Image upload errors
- Network failures

==================================================

Create:

/admin/settings

Allow admin to manage:

- Store name
- Logo
