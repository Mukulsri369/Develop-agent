## Architecture decisions

- The homepage planet opening uses Motion React with CDN-hosted clips/posters, stable preloaded cutout slots, intent-loaded videos, and offscreen/hidden/reduced-motion playback guards; the existing TanStack storefront and shopping navigation remain intact.
- Product category membership is stored atomically in an indexed category_ids array; validation checks category references and mirrors the first selection to legacy category_id for compatibility, while browsing and search match all selections.
- The storefront galaxy scene dynamically imports Three.js after mount, uses bounded particle counts, pauses offscreen, and honors reduced motion; this keeps SSR safe and browsing lightweight.
- Products, categories, settings, images, and click events are database-backed; public access is limited by row-level policies and admin writes use an allowlisted authenticated email.
- Store media uses private object storage served through a validated public image route so storage credentials never reach visitors.
- Retailer affiliate URLs are stored per product and passed through unchanged; outbound click logging is best-effort and never blocks navigation.
- Public product queries include the legacy Amazon URL and use it only when the retailer-neutral affiliate URL is missing, so older records retain working purchase links.
- A database trigger blocks publishing, activating, restoring live products, or changing live affiliate links when another record uses the same effective URL; drafts and trash count, self-edits do not, and URL comparison never rewrites stored links.
- Server routes that parse HTML import cheerio/slim, never the full cheerio entry; the full entry pulls Node-only code that crashes the live server.
- Retailer price parsing is shared by admin import and price checks; Amazon reads use complete buy-box amounts and retry only the resolved marketplace to avoid truncated cents or another country's offers.
